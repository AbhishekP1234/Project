my project is Melanin Index Measurement,in this project we have created a model using Arduino Nano to make size compact.here,our device measures the melanin index of a particular.it is measured using a particular statistical table i.e. van luschans scale,in the project we have mapled a colour sensor(RGB sensor) with Arduino to give values depend pn van luschans scale.usinh the RGB values we can determine the melanin index of particular,this project is used in skin care and cosmetics
